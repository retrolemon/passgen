# passgen
A simple password generator with an adjustable character set and password length

# Updates
- Completely removed the `os` keys from `config.json`
- Added dynamic json updating

## How to Use
You can run the program by using `console.py`.
You could also use `passgen.py` as a separate module in a project,
if you do, be sure to give credit.

# config.json
I think you can tell what the keys
are for.
Edit them however you please.
