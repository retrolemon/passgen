# passgen
A simple password generator with an adjustable character set and password length

## How to Use
You can run the program by using `console.py`.
You could also use `passgen.py` as a separate module in a project,
if you do, be sure to give credit.

# config.json
By default, the key `os` is already set to `win`.
Also I think you can tell what the other keys
are for.
Edit them however you please.

## win
If `os` is set to `win`, you need to enter `cls`
in the console to clear the screen.

## unix
If `os` is set to `unix`, you need to enter `clear`
in the console to clear the screen.

## else
`console.py` will require you to enter `clear` by default
if none of the above options are values.
